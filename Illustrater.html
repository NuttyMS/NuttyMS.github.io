  <p>Imma put a paragraph about why this issue is important lol. I guess like, Gaming Disorder is much more than just a <br>video game addiction.
  Gaming Disorder is a condition where gaming takes up higher priority than basic functions like sleep, human interaction, and food. <br>
there are cases of young people, especially in asia, going to internet cafe's, binging for multiple days at a time and actually succumbing to <br>
cardiac arrest. It is a tradgic waste of young life, and it is worthy of our attention. </p>
